### Introduction
This project contains a script that produces a tidied data set from a collection of files that represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Along with the script is a CodeBook that summarizes the steps in the script and the features of the tidied dataset produced by the script.

### Running the script

* Download [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/msbuckley/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/CleanData_project/run_analysis.R).

* Download [getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzip to local machine.

* Set working directory to location of unzipped data files and envoke `run_analysis.R` in your R environment.
